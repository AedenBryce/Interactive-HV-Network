# Implementation progress

The complete scope remains all 25 published implementation tickets and owner acceptance of the whole-network model. This record does not replace GitHub acceptance criteria.

## GitHub #2: first switching simulation

Implemented and reviewed locally. Implementation commit: `0836d48`; review baseline: `d753765` (owner approved).

- Synthetic source → CB-01 → TF-01 → LV bus model, version `fixture-1.0`.
- React/Vite local application, SVG single-line diagram, list/diagram selection, asset inspector and switching controls.
- Session-owned source connectivity, detached snapshots and atomic model validation.
- Session tests observed red before implementation, then passed for switching and invalid-input preservation.
- Typecheck and production build passed.
- Chrome browser check: Open CB-01, select LV bus and observe no source connection; Close CB-01 and observe the bus reconnect. No warning/error console messages were returned during the check.
- Separate standards and specification reviews reported no material findings for this ticket.
- Desktop screenshot compared with the design reference using image inspection: header/rail/canvas/inspector arrangement, copy, navy/teal/orange palette, symbol treatment and control spacing checked. Actual browser screenshot was 1704 × 1214; the browser adapter has no viewport resize capability, so exact reference-size and narrow-screen checks remain unverified.
- Model construction, other simulation features and all real-area tickets remain outstanding.

## Remaining acceptance gates

Whole-network source review, area models, cross-area reconciliation, baseline/interlock/source confirmation and explicit owner acceptance remain required. No installed-network fact has been confirmed by this software slice.
